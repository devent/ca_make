h1. Etcd CA Make

h2. Introduction

Contains Make script to create certificates for a Etcd cluster. Specifically, it creates a certificate authority to self sign the certificates, a Etcd server certificate and multiple Etcd worker certificates.

The project is designed to be cloned and to be run on a specific branch for a specific CA. The certificates and keys can also be committed to the repository. If a repository is used it should be held private because the scripts also keep track of the private key passphrases in plain text files. The proposed use case for the project is it to clone it and to checkout a new branch as shown in the example below. As an alternative, the project sources can also be downloaded and extracted in a new directory. A password-less key is also generated and saved with the @_insecure@ label.

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:devent/ca_make.git
git checkout -b nttdata
... create server certificates
</pre>

h2. Credits

* The project is based on the guide that can be found on "Cluster TLS using OpenSSL [coreos.com]":https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/openssl.html
* A description how to create Etcd certificates can be found at "Ubuntu Nodes with Calico [kubernetes.io]":http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/ubuntu-calico/
* "Deploy Etcd Master Node(s) [coreos.com]":https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/deploy-master.html

h2. Dependencies

The project requires the following tool.

* @make@ to run Makefile scripts;
* @openssl@ to create and sign certificates;
* @pwgen@ to generate passphrases for the certificate keys.

h2. Configuration

The @openssl.cnf@ file contains the configurations for the Etcd server and clients, respectively, of the Openssl client. The top of the file contains some default values to create server certificates and should be changed to one's own needs.

<pre>
# Change those for you own needs.
KEY_SIZE               = 2048
KEY_COUNTRY            = DE
KEY_PROVINCE           = BAVARIA
KEY_CITY               = MUNICH
KEY_ORG                = ECTD-CA
KEY_ORGUNIT            = ERWIN MUELLER Certificate Authority
KEY_COMMON_NAME        = ERWIN MUELLER Etcd CA
KEY_EMAIL              = admin@muellerpublic.de
ETCD_SAN               = "IP:127.0.0.1"

# Set the CRL distribution URL.
CRL_URL                = URI:https://muellerpublic.de/etcd.crl.pem

# Set the OCSP distribution URL.
OCSP_URL               = OCSP;URI:http://ocsp.muellerpublic.de
</pre>

h2. Usage

h3. ./Makefile

* @make@
* @make run@

Creates the Etcd certificate authority.

* @make clean@

Deletes all created directories and files.

* @make show@

Shows the certificate.

* @make server@

Creates a new client certificate, needed arguments are @SERVER_NAME@, 
and optionally, the FQDN of the server,
and @ETCD_SAN@, the additional SANs.

* @make client@

Creates a new client certificate, needed arguments are @CLIENT_NAME@.

h2. Generated Files
