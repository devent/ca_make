h1. CA Make

h2. Introduction

This project contains scripts to create a simple Certificate Authority that can issue and sign certificates and keeps track of them by a simple serial number system. The project is based on @make@ scripts, because we need to keep track of files and run commands on the shell. The @make@ tool is originally designed to run source code build tools like @gcc@, but it is perfectly suited to build certificates. The project is designed to be cloned and to be run on a specific branch for a specific CA. The certificates and keys can also be committed to the repository. If a repository is used it should be held private because the scripts also keep track of the private key passphrases in plain text files. The proposed use case for the project is it to clone it and to checkout a new branch as shown in the example below. As an alternative, the project sources can also be downloaded and extracted in a new directory.

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:devent/ca_make.git
git checkout -b nttdata
... create server certificates
</pre>

The project creates a root CA and an intermediate CA that can create server certificates and sign them. It can also revoke server certificates and regenerate the certificate revocation lists. Basic functions can be accessed by the main @./Makefile@ in the base directory and more advanced functions are located in the intermediate CA directory @./intermediate/Makefile@.

* @./Makefile@
* @./root/Makefile@
* @./root/openssl.cnf@
* @./intermediate/Makefile@
* @./intermediate/openssl.cnf@

h2. Credits

The project is based on a tutorial from Jamie Nguyen that can be found on "jamielinux.com":https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/index.html

h2. Dependencies

The project requires the following tool.

* @make@ to run Makefile scripts;
* @openssl@ to create and sign certificates;
* @pwgen@ to generate passphrases for the certificate keys.

h2. Configuration

The @root/openssl.cnf@ and @intermediate/openssl.cnf@ file contains the main configuration of the Openssl client. The top of the file contains some default values to create server certificates and should be changed to one's own needs.

<pre>
# Change those for you own needs.
KEY_SIZE               = 2048
KEY_COUNTRY            = DE
KEY_PROVINCE           = BAVARIA
KEY_CITY               = MUNICH
KEY_ORG                = ERWIN MUELLER
KEY_ORGUNIT            = ERWIN MUELLER Certificate Authority
KEY_COMMON_NAME        = ERWIN MUELLER Root CA
KEY_EMAIL              = admin@muellerpublic.de

# Set the CRL distribution URL.
CRL_URL                = URI:https://muellerpublic.de/intermediate.crl.pem

# Set the OCSP distribution URL.
OCSP_URL               = OCSP;URI:http://ocsp.muellerpublic.de
</pre>

h2. Usage
